Description:
This project aims to create an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navigation menu will have fixed positioning, remaining visible on all pages. Interactivity will be added to the menu, such as changing its color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item.

Instructions:

HTML Structure:

The navigation menu will be structured using HTML <nav> and <ul> elements.
Each menu item will be represented by an <li> element within the <ul>.
CSS Styling:

CSS will be used to style the navigation menu, including its layout, colors, and fonts.
Media queries may be used for responsiveness across different screen sizes.
JavaScript Interactivity:

JavaScript will be utilized to add interactivity to the navigation menu.
Event listeners will be implemented to detect scrolling and hovering over menu items.
Functions will be created to change the menu's appearance dynamically based on these events.

Implementation:

Ensure that all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are linked correctly in your project structure.
Test the navigation menu thoroughly across different browsers and devices to ensure proper functionality and styling.

File Structure:

index.html: Main HTML file containing the structure of the navigation menu.
styles.css: CSS file for styling the navigation menu.
script.js: JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the navigation menu.
